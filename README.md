# DevOps-Project
I developed a fully automated DevOps pipeline that streamlines the process of building, testing, deploying, and monitoring applications in a cloud-native environment. The project integrates modern tools like Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes, and Ansible to achieve continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD).
